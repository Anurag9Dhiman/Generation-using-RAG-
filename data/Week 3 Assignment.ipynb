If the way marks are stored or calculated changes (e.g., adding more subjects, using weighted averages), the client code will likely need to be updated.\n",
    "*   **Violation of Encapsulation:** While getters and setters provide a layer of control over data access, they still expose the raw data, making the object's internal state more visible and potentially leading to logic being scattered outside the class.\n",

    "**Behavioural Encapsulation Implementation (`StudentBehavioural`):**\n",

    "*   **\"Tell\":** To get the grade, you \"tell\" the object to perform the action (`calculate_grade()`). The object knows how to calculate its own grade based on its internal state (`__marks`), and the client code doesn't need to know the details of how that calculation is done.\n",
    "*   **Decoupling:** This reduces coupling. The client code interacts with the object through its behavior (`calculate_grade()`) rather than its data. Changes to the internal calculation logic within `calculate_grade()` do not require changes to the client code, as long as the method signature remains the same.\n",

This results in a more cohesive class, reduced coupling, and better adherence to the principles of encapsulation."
